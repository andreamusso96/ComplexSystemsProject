    "# Compare Greedy Algorithm to Degree Centrality\n",
    "This code goes through different numbers of starting set sizes and computes both the most degree central and the greedy approximated starting set. It then runs the simulation on both of them seperately and compares the resulting cascade sizes. Additionaly, it applies the function that the greedy algorithm uses to estimate the cascade size on both sets. Then for each size, the mean over multiple samples is plotted."
