> * Project Title: The spreading of (fake) news in social networks

## General Introduction
The spreading of false news on social media has become a major issue in recent years. The uncontrolled circulation of biased and false information is eroding fundamental pillars of liberal societies as fair elections, free speech and public debate, thereby leading to increasing division and polarisation. This issue has provoked wide interest in the scientific community, leading to many interdisciplinary research projects (see for instance [1], [2], [3]). However, "false news science" is still in its infancy and a solution to the false news problem is still far from sight. The aim of our project is to provide a small contribution to the understanding of this problem, via agent based models and simulations.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

With our model and code we aspire to answer specific cases of the following three broad research questions:
* **Q1:** How does network structure impact the spreading of a news?
* **Q2:** What impact does the choice of initial spreaders have on the spreading of competing news? What is the best choice of spreaders when one aims to maximise cascade size?

## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
