## General Introduction
The spreading of false news on social media has become a major issue in recent years. The uncontrolled circulation of biased and false information is eroding fundamental pillars of liberal societies as fair elections, free speech and public debate, thereby leading to increasing division and polarisation. This issue has provoked wide interest in the scientific community, leading to many interdisciplinary research projects (see for instance [1], [2], [3]). However, "false news science" is still in its infancy and a solution to the false news problem is still far from sight. The aim of our project is to provide a small contribution to the understanding of this problem, via agent based models and simulations.

## The Model

The details of our model are described in the report. Here, we will only mention the fact that we are using a threshold model inspired the work of REF.
This model is well recognized as one of the most accurate diffusion models on complex networks and we find it well suited for our task.

## Fundamental Questions

With our model and code we aspire to answer specific cases of the following three broad research questions:
* **Q1:** How does network structure impact the spreading of a news?
* **Q2:** What impact does the choice of initial spreaders have on the spreading of competing news? What is the best choice of spreaders when one aims to maximise cascade size?

## Expected Results

We expect a strong impact of network structure on the cascade size of a given news. News should spread more in dense networks with short average shortest paths between nodes. We also expect that the choice of initial spreaders has a strong influence on the spreading of news. For what concerns the best choice of initial spreaders we do not really know what to expect.
